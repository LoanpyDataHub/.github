# LoanpyDataHub

A diverse dataset collection for investigating loanwords in various languages.

## Introduction

LoanpyDataHub is a project originating from a PhD thesis, focused on unveiling ancient loanwords, with an initial emphasis on Gothic and Hungarian. Our goal is to expand the scope to cover more languages, creating a versatile linguistic resource.

## Collaboration

We encourage collaboration and contributions from the linguistic community to help grow and enrich LoanpyDataHub. If you're interested in participating, please feel free to contact us or submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
